## 1. WHAT THIS PROJECT IS

J-TACS is an enterprise tax operations management platform for Indian CA/tax firms. It manages:
- Client portfolio (GST, ITR, TDS, Payroll, Audit, ROC filings)
- Work tracker (Kanban board of tasks per client)
- Compliance calendar (deadline tracking with status)
- Payments & invoicing (with overdue tracking)
- Document vault (Supabase Storage with signed URLs)
- Employee/team management with role-based access
- WhatsApp + email messaging (via Resend; WhatsApp uses real Meta Cloud API when configured)
- Client-facing portal (separate UI for CLIENT-role users)
- Reporting center (CSV/XLSX/PDF export)
- **Workforce Intelligence** (session tracking, attendance, performance, alerts — PARTNER-only)
- **Proposals & Quotations** (Lead CRM, quotation builder, PDF, email automation, client portal)

## 8. REMAINING WORK (priority order)

### CRITICAL — Before First Production User
1. **Configure Firm Settings** — Log in as PARTNER → Settings → Firm Details. Set firm name and sender email. The wizard's Step 1 also writes these to the FirmSettings DB row.
2. **Activate RLS** — Run `prisma/migrations-manual/002_rls_policies.sql` in Supabase SQL editor. Covers all 36 tables with 56 policies. See `RLS_ACTIVATION_GUIDE.md`.
3. **Run firm-settings domain migration** — `prisma/migrations-manual/003_firm_settings_domain.sql` adds the 5 columns needed by the Domain Verification UI. Idempotent.
4. **Set `PLATFORM_FROM_EMAIL`** env var — a Resend-verified address on a platform-owned domain. Unverified firms send with firm display name via this address with Reply-To routing back to the firm. Without it, the "Mode B" fallback isn't available.
5. **Verify firm's domain in Resend** (or platform domain at minimum) — direct branded send requires the firm's domain to be a verified Resend identity. The in-app DNS Verification UI guides PARTNERs through this.

### HIGH — Security
4. **Upstash Redis rate limiter** — In-memory rate limiter resets on serverless cold starts. Migration path documented in `lib/security/rate-limiter.ts`.

### MEDIUM — Testing
5. **Playwright E2E test suite** — No automated tests. Priority scenarios: CLIENT cannot access `/`, EMPLOYEE cannot access `/payments`, EMPLOYEE sees only assigned clients, PARTNER sees all data, password reset end-to-end.

### LOW — Quality
6. **WhatsApp Business API** — Set `WHATSAPP_API_TOKEN` + `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID` in `.env` to enable real WhatsApp messaging.
7. **Supabase `documents` bucket** — Verify exists in Supabase dashboard; `assertDocumentBucketExists()` creates on first upload automatically.
